I was given a book to learn c++. I thought to make github of the book of the code whould be a great idea for people to use. The book is called, "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming, Third Edition" By Michael Daweson [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-C-Through-Game-Programming/dp/1435457420)

My goal: Finish it over the 2020 Summer
