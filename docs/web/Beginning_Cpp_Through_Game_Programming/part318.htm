From the player<span class="s12">’</span>s perspective, the Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0 game looks exactly the same as the original because the changes are under the hood<span class="s12">— </span>I<span class="s12">’</span>ve replaced all of the references with pointers. This means that objects such as the Tic-Tac-Toe board are passed as constant pointers instead of as references. This has other implications, including the fact that the address of a Tic-Tac-Toe board must be passed instead of the board itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.courseptr.com/downloads" class="s15" target="_blank">You can download the code for the new version of the program from the Course Technology website (</a>www.courseptr.com/downloads). The program is in the Chapter 7 folder; the filename is <span class="s35">tic-tac-toe2.cpp</span>. I won<span class="s12">’</span>t go over the code because most of it remains the same. But even though the number of changes isn<span class="s12">’</span>t great, the changes are significant. This is a good program to study because, although you should use references whenever you can, you should be equally comfortable with pointers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part317.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part319.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
