In this program, I can simply use the function <span class="s35">instructions() </span>without worrying about the details of displaying the text. All I have to do is call the function with one line of code, and it gets the job done.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark562">You might be surprised where you find abstraction, but people use it all the time. For example, consider two employees at a fast-food restaurant. If one tells the other that he just filled a Number 3 and </a><span class="s12">“</span>sized it,<span class="s12">” </span>the other employee knows that the first employee took a customer<span class="s12">’</span>s order, went to the heat lamps, grabbed a burger, went over to the deep fryer, filled their biggest cardboard container with french fries, went to the soda fountain, grabbed their biggest cup, filled it with soda, gave it all to the customer, took the customer<span class="s12">’</span>s money, and gave the customer change. Not only would this level of detail make for a boring conversation, but it<span class="s12">’</span>s unnecessary. Both employees understand what it means to fill a Number 3 and <span class="s12">“</span>size it.<span class="s12">” </span>They don<span class="s12">’</span>t have to concern themselves with all the details because they<span class="s12">’</span>re using abstraction.<a name="bookmark563">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark616">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark617">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part204.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part206.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
