If to err is human, then programmers are the most human of us. Even the best programmers write code that generates errors the first (or fifth) time through. Programmers must fix the errors and start the entire process over. Here are the basic types of errors you<span class="s12">’</span>ll run into as you program in C<span class="s14">þþ</span>:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s29">n </span><b>Compile errors. </b>These occur during code compilation. As a result, an object file is not produced. These can be <span class="s11">syntax errors</span>, meaning that the compiler doesn<span class="s12">’</span>t understand something. They<span class="s12">’</span>re often caused by some- thing as simple as a typo. Compilers can issue warnings, too. Although you usually don<span class="s12">’</span>t have to heed the warnings, you should treat them as errors, fix them, and recompile.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;"><span class="s29">n </span><b>Link errors. </b>These occur during the linking process and may indicate that something the program references externally can<span class="s12">’</span>t be found. These errors are usually solved by adjusting the offending reference and starting the compile/link process again.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s29">n </span><b>Run-time errors. </b>These occur when the executable is run. If the program does something illegal, it can crash abruptly. But a more subtle form of run-time error, a <span class="s11">logical error</span>, can make the program simply behave in unintended ways. If you<span class="s12">’</span>ve ever played a game where a character walked on air (that is, a character who shouldn<span class="s12">’</span>t be able to walk on air), then you<span class="s12">’</span>ve seen a logical error in action.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rea l Worl d</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="517" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_024.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Like other software creators, game companies work hard to produce bug-free products. Their last line of defense is the quality assurance personnel (the game testers). Game testers play games for a living, but their jobs are not as fun as you might think. Testers must play the same parts of a game over and over—perhaps hundreds of times—trying the unexpected and meticulously recording any anomalies. On top of monotonous work, the pay ain’t great either. But being a tester is a terrific way to get into a game company on the proverbial bottom rung.</p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="498" height="3" alt="image" src="Image_025.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 278pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark22">Writing Your First C</a><span class="s36">þþ </span>Program 5<a name="bookmark83">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark84">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part13.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part15.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
