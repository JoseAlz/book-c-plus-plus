But games are a form of enter- tainment unlike any other; they can keep players glued to their monitors for hours on end. What sets games apart and makes them so engrossing is interactivity. In a computer game, you don<span class="s12">’</span>t simply sit back and watch a hero ﬁghting against all odds, you <span class="s11">become </span>the hero.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The key to achieving this interactivity is programming. It<span class="s12">’</span>s programming that allows an alien creature, an attack squadron, or an entire army to react differently to a player in different situations. Through programming, a game<span class="s12">’</span>s story can unfold in new ways. In fact, as the result of programming, a game can respond to a player in ways that the game creators might never have imagined.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although there are literally thousands of computer programming languages, C<span class="s14">þþ </span>is the game industry standard. If you were to wander the PC game section of your favorite store and grab a title at random, the odds are overwhelming that the game in your hand would be written largely or exclusively in C<span class="s14">þþ</span>. The bottom line is this: If you want to program computer games professionally, you must know C<span class="s14">þþ</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The goal of this book is to introduce you to the C<span class="s14">þþ </span>language from a game programming perspective. Although no single book can make you the master of two deep topics such as C<span class="s14">þþ </span>and game programming, this book will start you on your journey.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">xviii</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 374pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction xix</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part5.htm">Who This Book Is For</a><a class="toc0" href="part6.htm">How This Book Is Organized</a><a class="toc0" href="part7.htm">Conventions Used in This Book</a><a class="toc0" href="part8.htm">Source Code for the Programs in this Book</a><a class="toc0" href="part9.htm">A Word about Compilers</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part3.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part5.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
