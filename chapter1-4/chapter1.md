## Chapter 1 - Types, Variables, and Standard I/O: Lost Fortune.

`You’ll be introduced to the fundamentals of C++, the standard language of the game industry. You’ll learn to display output in a console window, perform arithmetic computations, use variables, and get player input from the keyboard.`

Game programming is demanding. It pushes both programmer and hardware to their limits. But it can also be extremely satisfying. In this chapter, you’ll be introduced to the fundamentals of C++, the standard language for AAA game titles. Specifically, you’ll learn to:

* Display output in a console window
* Perform arithmetic computations
* Use variables to store, manipulate, and retrieve data 
* Get user input
* Work with constants and enumerations
* Work with strings
